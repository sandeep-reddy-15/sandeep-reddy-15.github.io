                                <p>To address the case, I began by conducting preliminary analysis on the dataset provided. I calculated the percentage of customers who responded to the deal offer message by determining the proportion of buyers among all customers. Additionally, I computed the average number of sessions purchased by customers who bought one or more 30-minute sessions, using the ordersize variable for the calculation. These initial steps helped in understanding the response rate and purchase behavior of customers.

                                    Next, I built targeting models to predict customer response and order size using logistic regression and linear regression, respectively. For the logistic regression model, I used buyer as the dependent variable and recency, frequency, monetary, age, gender, and music as the explanatory variables. I created prediction plots for all explanatory variables and assessed variable importance using Permutation Importance. Similarly, for the linear regression model, I used ordersize as the response variable and the same set of explanatory variables, focusing only on customers who placed an order after receiving the deal offer message.
                                    
                                    In the profitability analysis, I calculated the breakeven response rate and projected profit based on offering the deal to all remaining potential customers. I evaluated the performance implications of targeting customers with a predicted probability of purchase greater than the breakeven response rate and compared the projected profit and return on marketing expenditures for different targeting approaches. Finally, I recreated the plots using the dataset with actual results from the deal offer roll-out and analyzed the actual performance of the targeting approaches. Throughout the analysis, I ensured to adhere to the guidelines provided and made data-driven decisions based on the insights obtained from the models and calculations.

                                <h4> A Gaming Company</h4>
                                <p>
                                    As a developer at XYZ gaming, we've observed significant growth in our customer base, largely attributed to ads displayed through the Vneta ad-network. These ads, primarily short video clips emphasizing our game dynamics, have been instrumental in attracting new users. However, our targeting strategy could be more efficient. Currently, we're considering options to enhance our targeting, including purchasing additional data from Vneta or subscribing to their analytics consultancy service. The challenge lies in evaluating the effectiveness of these options against our current approach, especially considering the associated costs.

                                To address this challenge, I've delved into logistic regression modeling using our available data. By estimating logistic regression models, I aim to predict the probability of ad click-through, which can significantly inform our targeting strategy. Through model evaluation, including assessing statistical significance, permutation importance, and prediction plots, I'll identify the most influential variables and gauge the overall model performance using metrics like Pseudo R-squared and the Chi-square test. Additionally, I'll explore the implications of multicollinearity and omitted variable bias, ensuring the robustness of our models.

                                With logistic regression models estimated and predictions generated, I'll proceed to compare different targeting strategies. By simulating upcoming ad campaigns and extrapolating costs and benefits, I'll evaluate options such as spamming all prospects, continuing with our current approach, utilizing predictions from logistic regression models, or relying on Vneta's predictions. Ultimately, my aim is to recommend the most effective and cost-efficient targeting strategy for XYZ gaming, considering both short-term gains and long-term brand awareness.

                                <p>
                                    In this case, our objective is to predict which businesses, out of the 22,500 in the test set, are most likely to respond to a wave-2 mailing offering an upgrade to the latest version of QuickBooks software. The provided data includes various customer attributes such as ZIP code, previous purchase history, time since last order, and more. Our task involves developing predictive models using logistic regression and neural networks to identify potential responders.

                                Firstly, we'll explore and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Then, we'll proceed to develop logistic regression and neural network models, evaluating their predictive performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Techniques like cross-validation will be utilized to ensure the robustness of our models.

                                After selecting the best-performing model, we'll use it to predict response probabilities for businesses in the test set. Subsequently, we'll calculate the anticipated profit from the wave-2 mailing by estimating the margin from each responder and subtracting the mailing cost. Considering the assumed 50% drop-off in response from wave-1 to wave-2, we'll finalize our target list for the wave-2 mailing, aiming to maximize profit while minimizing costs. Finally, we'll document our approach, model evaluation, and decision-making process in a concise report.

                                <h4>Gaming Marketing</h4>
                                <p>Galactic Entertainment's venture into the mobile gaming market with Cosmic Raiders proved to be a resounding success, capturing the essence of console gaming on Apple iOS devices. With its engaging cooperative multiplayer action-adventure gameplay, Cosmic Raiders quickly became one of the most downloaded games. Players embarked on space voyages aboard customizable cargo spaceships, navigating through a rich outer-space environment filled with both player-controlled and AI-powered ships.

                                    To sustain player engagement and revenue generation, Galactic Entertainment introduced in-app purchases in the form of elaborate campaign adventures. However, the uptake of the first campaign, Nebula Quest, fell short of expectations, prompting concern among the leadership team. Despite pricing the campaign at $14.99 and relying on word-of-mouth promotion, only a small fraction of active players purchased it within two months of release.
                                    
                                    In response to the slow adoption of the Nebula Quest campaign, Galactic Entertainment's CMO, Alex Chen, convened a team meeting to brainstorm solutions. The team hypothesized that the pricing might be perceived as too high for a mobile game, and there could be an awareness gap hindering sales. Instead of immediately adjusting the price, they decided to leverage the company's in-app advertising capabilities and advanced analytics to raise awareness about the campaign's value proposition, hoping to boost sales without compromising on pricing integrity.

                                <h4>Gaming Marketing - Uplift Model Concept</h4>
                                <p>The task involves conducting uplift modeling for customer targeting in a marketing campaign, focusing on maximizing incremental profits. The dataset comprises two groups: a control group (customers who did not receive an ad) and an experimental group (customers who received a randomly chosen ad). The goal is to compare the performance of uplift modeling against propensity modeling in identifying customers for targeting.

                                    To address the task, I first prepared the data by adding the "ad" variable to both groups and created a stacked dataset for analysis. Then, using logistic regression, I trained an uplift model and calculated the uplift score. Subsequently, I compared the performance of the uplift model with a propensity model, considering metrics like uplift percentage and incremental uplift.
                                    
                                    Further, I repeated the process using Random Forest and XGBoost models, tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance. Finally, I determined the optimal percentage of customers to target using both propensity and uplift models and calculated the incremental profits expected from targeting this percentage. The analysis provided insights into the effectiveness of different modeling approaches in maximizing profits through customer targeting.

                                <h4>"Optimizing Customer Engagement and Profitability: A Data-Driven Approach to Email Strategy"</h4>
                                <p>The scenario follows the journey of Alex Rivera, who aims to validate a new e-mail strategy aimed at enhancing customer engagement and profitability. To substantiate the proposed strategy, Rivera orchestrates a randomized test to evaluate the impact of different e-mail frequencies on customer behavior and financial outcomes over six months. By randomly assigning customers to various e-mail frequency groups, Rivera endeavors to address concerns surrounding customer opt-outs and long-term profitability. The test findings suggest that sending two e-mails per week achieves the most favorable outcome, balancing revenue increments with mitigated unsubscribe rates.

                                    Post-test, Rivera proposes a revised e-mail policy grounded in personalized message allocation, leveraging customer analytics to optimize expected profits. The proposed policy involves allocating e-mails to departments based on forecasted profit potential for individual customers, fostering collaboration and efficiency across departments. While the proposal presents promising prospects, potential drawbacks include operational complexity and the need for ongoing monitoring and refinement. One potential enhancement could involve streamlining the process for improved practicality and scalability.
                                    
                                    In executing the case analysis, the team adheres to Alex's directives by employing logistic regression, neural networks, random forests, and XGBoost to predict customer behavior and profitability across different promotional e-mail messages. Hyperparameter tuning is undertaken for each model to enhance performance. Furthermore, the team harnesses Generative AI tools like ChatGPT to bolster their endeavors, facilitating discussions and augmenting problem-solving capabilities. While the primary emphasis lies on generating tailored predictions for each customer, the team also evaluates the proposed e-mail policy critically, weighing its ramifications and potential improvements.
