                                <h4>Carlos Morales Case</h4>
                                <p>Faced with the question of how to navigate the challenging waters of innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment, I delved into the predicament of Carlos Morales. Carlos, an inventive mind with a promising product idea, was caught in a whirlwind of decision-making that spanned technical feasibility, market reception, financial risk, and the contemplation of an angel investor's offer. The crux of Carlos's dilemma lay in weighing the 50% chance of technical success against the optimism of an 80% market favorability, all while considering whether to undertake market research and accept a conditional loan from an angel investor.

                                    To address this multifaceted situation, I turned to decision trees and Expected Monetary Value (EMV) analysis as my guiding tools. These methods allowed me to break down Carlos's situation into quantifiable outcomes and probabilities, providing a structured way to evaluate the potential financial implications of each path. My solution involved a strategic recommendation to proceed without the angel investor and to forgo the additional market research. This decision was rooted in the calculated EMV, which revealed that maintaining full control over the project and avoiding the high costs associated with the investor's loan terms and the market research fee would lead to a higher expected financial return.
                                    
                                    In synthesizing my advice for Carlos, I emphasized the importance of flexibility and adaptability. While the quantitative analysis provided a clear direction based on financial metrics, I acknowledged the critical role of qualitative factors and the unpredictable nature of the market and technological development. Thus, I advised Carlos to stay open to revisiting his decisions as new information became available, underscoring the entrepreneurial journey's dynamic and uncertain nature. My approach offered Carlos a blend of strategic foresight and practical advice, aiming to navigate the complexities of innovation with a calculated and informed mindset.

                                <h4> RadySafe Insurance Fraud</h4>
                                <p>
                                    I've been contracted by RadySafe Insurance to help them navigate through a challenging period marked by underperforming investments and rising concerns over fraudulent claims. My task involves analyzing a sample of 4,415 claims from the past year to inform several critical decisions. The primary question I'm addressing encapsulates evaluating the need for a premium increase based on changes in average claim amounts, investigating whether premiums should be adjusted for different demographic groups due to variations in claim behavior, and assessing the effectiveness of the company's recent investments in fraud detection technologies. My analysis will utilize statistical tests to examine differences in claim amounts by gender and retirement status, and to compare fraud detection rates and claim amounts between fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims. This thorough examination is essential for guiding RadySafe Insurance in making informed decisions about premium adjustments, considering demographic-based pricing strategies, and determining the future direction of their fraud detection efforts, all aimed at enhancing the company's operational efficiency and financial health.

                                <h4>Shared Social Responsibility</h4>
                                <p>In this analysis, I was tasked with exploring the effectiveness of different pricing strategies at an amusement park, specifically focusing on flat-rate versus Name Your Own Price (NYOP) options, both with and without a charitable component. The experiment aimed to determine how these pricing strategies affected the number of photographs sold, total riders, and merchandise revenues, with a particular interest in whether incorporating a charity donation would influence consumer purchasing behavior. To do this, I delved into two datasets: "Sales.csv," providing an overview of sales and ridership across all pricing conditions, and "NYOP.csv," offering detailed insights into consumer choices under the NYOP conditions. My primary objectives were to compare the proportion of purchases between conditions, analyze average unit prices, and evaluate the impact on both the theme park's profits and societal benefits.

                                    For the flat-rate pricing analysis, I manually calculated the difference in the proportion of purchases between the FR and FR Charity conditions without relying on built-in t-test functions. I formulated null and alternative hypotheses to assess if the charitable aspect influenced the purchasing proportion, computed the test statistic for population proportion differences, and determined the significance and p-value to interpret the results.
                                    Through these analyses, I aimed to provide the amusement park with insights into how different pricing strategies could be optimized for revenue, the potential for societal benefit through charitable donations, and the overall impact on consumer behavior. This comprehensive approach allowed me to recommend strategies that balance profit maximization with social responsibility.

                                <h4>Ontario Gateway</h4>
                                <p>I conducted a comprehensive simulation to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different insurance policies for an airline fleet over a five-year period. The fleet consisted of various aircraft types, each with specific costs and operational parameters. I aimed to assess the financial impact of potential damages and the performance of four distinct insurance policies—RCNC1, RCNC2, CTC, and HIC—under varying conditions of aircraft losses. This involved calculating the total fleet value, simulating annual damage incidents based on a given probability of damage, and applying the terms of each insurance policy to determine the total cost incurred due to damages and insurance premiums.

                                    The policies differed in their structure, from flat annual premiums to combinations of fixed and variable premiums, and included specific conditions like deductibles and coverage limits. To determine the most cost-effective policy, I simulated thousands of scenarios to account for random incidents of damage and incidental costs, adjusting the insurance cost calculations based on actual damages incurred and incorporating potential rebates for profits under specific policies.
                                    
                                    The script meticulously filters out policies that would lead to unsustainable costs, taking into account a safety margin to ensure financial viability. By aggregating the results of the simulations and applying rebates where applicable, I derived a clear comparison across policies based on their total costs over the simulated period. The final step involved identifying the policy that, on average, offers the lowest cost, thereby providing a data-driven recommendation for the airline to select the insurance policy that best mitigates financial risk while ensuring coverage for potential losses.

                                <h4>Hot Hand</h4>
                                <p>In my exploration of the hot hand phenomenon in basketball, I utilized NBA player salary and performance data from the 2012/2013 season to develop a linear model linking various performance metrics to player salaries. This analysis began with visualizing data distributions and creating scatterplots to understand the relationships between salary and performance indicators such as age, field goals, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and points. The initial regression analysis, which omitted points scored (PTS) to focus on other metrics, helped identify significant predictors of salary. This step involved interpreting the coefficients to understand their impact on salary, relying on the statistical significance of each predictor. To address the data's skewness, I applied a logarithmic transformation to the salary variable, enhancing the model's interpretability by transitioning to a log-scale analysis.

                                    The inclusion of PTS in subsequent models (Regression C and D) revealed its influence on salary, prompting adjustments in the model to refine our understanding of performance metrics' impact. The transformation of salary and the introduction of standardized coefficients enabled a nuanced comparison of predictors, offering insights into the relative importance of various performance metrics in determining player salaries. This phase underscored the complexity of attributing salary levels to specific on-court achievements, highlighting the multifaceted nature of player valuation in the NBA.
                                    
                                    Diving into the hot hand hypothesis testing, I employed a conditional probability approach and a streaks approach to statistically assess the presence of the hot hand. Analyzing shooting data, I explored the probabilities of making shots after previous successes or failures, alongside sequences of hits and misses to evaluate streakiness. This rigorous statistical examination aimed to validate the hot hand theory by comparing observed shooting patterns against expected outcomes based on players' overall shooting probabilities. Throughout this process, my analysis not only sought to unravel the statistical evidence behind the hot hand phenomenon but also aimed to provide a comprehensive view of how performance metrics influence NBA players' salaries, blending rigorous data analysis with the intriguing psychological aspect of perceived streakiness in sports performance.

                                <h4>Croq Pan</h4>
                                <p>In addressing the Croq'Pain case, I first conducted exploratory data analysis by visualizing histograms and scatterplots to identify any anomalies. Recognizing skewed correlations between certain variables, I implemented a normalization technique to mitigate these issues. This involved creating new variables by dividing specific metrics by the total. This transformation ensured a more balanced representation of the data and facilitated a clearer understanding of the relationships between variables.

                                    Following the transformation, I compared correlations and regressions using both the original and transformed data. While both approaches were explored, I found the transformed data to be more preferable due to its improved interpretability and reduced multicollinearity. Leveraging Radiant's VIF feature, I assessed multicollinearity and examined standardized coefficients to determine the significance of predictors. Additionally, I utilized linear regression validation checks, such as dashboard plots, to validate the robustness of the model.
                                    
                                    In the subsequent stages, I focused on specific subsets of the data to tailor the analysis. For instance, in Part (b), I narrowed down the dataset to include only stores opened prior to a certain year. After constructing regression models using these subsets, I used the Predict tab in Radiant to make predictions based on the model's insights. Finally, in Part (c), I continued to leverage Radiant's features to conduct comprehensive analyses, ensuring thorough examination and interpretation of the Croq'Pain case.
